## Archive Usage Guidelines

**NEVER link to files in the archive directory.** The archive will be deleted at some point.

- Always copy assets from archive to their proper locations in the current project structure
- Update paths to reference the copied files, not the archive
- The archive directory is temporary reference material only
- When copying assets, place them in appropriate directories (e.g., docs/assets/)
- Update all references to use the new locations

This prevents broken links when the archive is eventually removed.
