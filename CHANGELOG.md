After two years of neglect, _tgintegration_ is finally back!
With Pyrogram turning `asyncio`-native and a huge demand in proper testing capabilities for Telegram Bots, it was time to give the library the love it deserves. Thus I hereby present to you the initial 1.0 Release - async by default, fully capable, and well-tested.

## Features

- 👤 Log into a Telegram user account and interact with bots or other users
- ✅ Write **realtime integration tests** to ensure that your bot works as expected! ▶️ [Pytest examples](https://github.com/JosXa/tgintegration/tree/master/examples/pytest)
- ⚡️ **Automate any interaction** on Telegram! ▶️ [Automation examples](https://github.com/JosXa/tgintegration/tree/master/examples/automation)
