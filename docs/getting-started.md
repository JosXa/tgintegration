# Getting Started

_You can [follow along by running the example](https://github.com/JosXa/tgintegration/blob/master/examples/readme_example/readmeexample.py) ([README](https://github.com/JosXa/tgintegration/blob/master/examples/README.md))_

#### Setup

Suppose we want to write integration tests for [@BotListBot](https://t.me/BotListBot) by sending it a couple of
messages and checking that it responds the way it should.

After [configuring a Pyrogram **user client**](https://docs.pyrogram.org/intro/setup),
let's start by creating a `BotController`:

``` python
from tgintegration import BotController

controller = BotController(
    peer="@BotListBot",      # The bot under test is https://t.me/BotListBot 🤖
    client=client,           # This assumes you already have a Pyrogram user client available
    max_wait=8,              # Maximum timeout for responses (optional)
    wait_consecutive=2,      # Minimum time to wait for more/consecutive messages (optional)
    raise_no_response=True,  # Raise `InvalidResponseError` when no response is received (defaults to True)
    global_action_delay=2.5  # Choosing a rather high delay so we can observe what's happening (optional)
)

await controller.clear_chat()  # Start with a blank screen (⚠️)
```

Now, let's send `/start` to the bot and wait until exactly three messages have been received by using the asynchronous `collect` context manager:

``` python
async with controller.collect(count=3) as response:
    await controller.send_command("start")

assert response.num_messages == 3  # Three messages received, bundled under a `Response` object
assert response.messages[0].sticker  # The first message is a sticker
```

The result should look like this:

Examining the buttons in the response...

``` python
# Get first (and only) inline keyboard from the replies
inline_keyboard = response.inline_keyboards[0]

# Three buttons in the first row
assert len(inline_keyboard.rows[0]) == 3
```

We can also press the inline keyboard buttons, for example based on a regular expression:

``` python
examples = await inline_keyboard.click(pattern=r".*Examples")
```

As the bot edits the message, `.click()` automatically listens for "message edited" updates and returns
the new state as another `Response`.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JosXa/tgintegration/master/docs/assets/examples_botlistbot.png)

``` python
assert "Examples for contributing to the BotList" in examples.full_text
```

#### Error handling

So what happens when we send an invalid query or the peer fails to respond?

The following instruction will raise an `InvalidResponseError` after `controller.max_wait` seconds.
This is because we passed `raise_no_response=True` during controller initialization.

``` python
try:
    async with controller.collect():
        await controller.send_command("ayylmao")
except InvalidResponseError:
    pass  # OK
```

Let's explicitly set `raise_` to `False` so that no exception occurs:

``` python
async with controller.collect(raise_=False) as response:
    await client.send_message(controller.peer_id, "Henlo Fren")
```

In this case, _tgintegration_ will simply emit a warning, but you can still assert
that no response has been received by using the `is_empty` property:

``` python
assert response.is_empty
```
